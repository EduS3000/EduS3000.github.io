# AI to identify arrhythmogenic sources in the heart from patient ECG

## Atrial Fibrillation (AF), a heart condition which affects 2% of the UK population, causes adverse health problems such as increased risk of stroke and low blood pressure. AF is caused by abnormal sources of electrical activity in the Left Atria. Current treatment procedure involve burning the area of abnormal electrical activity using catheter ablation or cryoablation. Currently, the procedure has a probabilistic approach, where most likely areas are burnt first and then it is checked if this has had an effect. This approach leads to further problems such as recurrent AF, as the true abnormal source may not be fully treated. If we could identify exactly where the abnormal source was initiating using time-series data from patient ECG and burn directly, this would improve patient outcome by minimising the time of the procedure and lowering the risk of recurrent AF.
